A galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas, dust, and other celestial objects bound together by gravity. Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and can range from small, irregularly shaped dwarf galaxies to large, spiral-shaped galaxies containing billions of stars.

The [[astronomy/Milky Way\|Milky Way]], the galaxy in which Earth is located, is estimated to contain around 100 billion stars, as well as a supermassive [[Black Hole\|Black Hole]] at its center. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, with arms of gas, dust, and stars spiraling out from the central bulge.

Galaxies are classified into several different types based on their shapes. Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, have a central bulge and spiral arms that extend outwards. Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, are shaped like ellipsoids and have no discernible structure. Irregular galaxies have no particular shape or structure and are often the result of gravitational interactions with other galaxies.

Galaxies are also classified based on their color, which is determined by the types of stars and other objects within them. Blue galaxies contain young, hot stars, while red galaxies contain older, cooler stars. Green galaxies are a mixture of both young and old stars.

Galaxies are thought to have formed shortly after the [[astronomy/Big Bang\|Big Bang]] when the [[Universe\|Universe]] was still in its infancy. Over time, galaxies have evolved and changed as stars are born and die, as well as through gravitational interactions with other galaxies.

Despite their enormous size, galaxies are still subject to the laws of physics and are affected by a range of phenomena, including black holes, [[supernova\|supernova]], and [[Dark Matter\|Dark Matter]]. Scientists continue to study galaxies to better understand their origins, evolution, and the intricate web of interactions that governs their behavior.

The study of galaxies has also led to a number of important discoveries and advancements in our understanding of the universe. For example, the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation\|cosmic microwave background radiation]], which is believed to be leftover radiation from the Big Bang, was a crucial piece of evidence in support of the Big Bang theory.
