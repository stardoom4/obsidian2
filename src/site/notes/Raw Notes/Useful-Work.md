In thermodynamics, useful work refers to the portion of work done by a system that can be used to accomplish a desired task. It is typically contrasted with [[Raw Notes/T Delta S\| non useful work]], which is energy that is dissipated as heat or other forms of energy that cannot be directly used to perform work.

The concept of useful work is closely related to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system, always increases over time. Useful work is associated with a decrease in entropy, while non-useful work is associated with an increase in entropy.

There are several different ways to quantify useful work in thermodynamics. One common method is to use the concept of exergy, which is defined as the maximum amount of useful work that can be extracted from a system. Another method is to use the Gibbs free energy, which is a measure of the available work in a system at a given temperature and pressure.

The efficiency of a thermodynamic process is typically defined as the ratio of the useful work done by the system to the total energy input. For example, the efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat input from the hot reservoir.

In practical applications, it is often difficult to achieve perfect efficiency. This is because some of the energy input is always lost as non-useful work. However, engineers strive to design systems that are as efficient as possible in order to maximize the amount of useful work that can be done.

Here are some examples of useful work in thermodynamics:

* **Lifting a weight**

* **Generating electricity**

* **Producing mechanical motion**

* **Compressing a gas**

* **Pumping a liquid**

These are just a few examples of the many ways in which useful work can be done in thermodynamics. Useful work is essential for many aspects of modern life, from transportation and manufacturing to power generation and climate control.
