"Lebensraum" is a German term that translates to "living space" in English. The concept gained prominence during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the context of German geopolitical and expansionist ambitions. Lebensraum referred to the belief or ideology that a nation or a particular ethnic group required additional territory or living space in order to secure its existence and ensure the well-being of its population.

Hitler believed that Germany needed to acquire additional land to accommodate its growing population, secure access to natural resources, and establish a buffer zone against potential enemies. This ideology played a significant role in the initiation of World War II and the subsequent German conquests in Eastern Europe, leading to devastating consequences and the loss of millions of lives.
