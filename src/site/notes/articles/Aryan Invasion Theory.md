As a person who leans towards Kurgan hypothesis from a macro IE perspective and obviously acknowledges Steppe MLBA admixture in South Asia, I'd like solid answers to the following in an Indo-Aryan context:

• Mittani are attested as early as 1761 BC in Tell Leilan. They bear later Vedic language characteristics, with words like pingala and prefixes/suffixes like brhad, sapta, uru, ksatra etc that appear akin to the later RV books. They have suffixes such as -ratha in their nobility names. Tusharatha-Dasharatha is a recognisable parallel. This means early Rigvedic is even prior to this, and definitely well before 1500 BC.

• There's elephant and peacock iconography and items associated with them as well which marks them as Indian rather than Andronovo in origin.

• Asiatic elephant remains in the near East are all post 1800 BC which lines up with this. Fauna specific to South Asia (elephant, chital/spotted deer, Indian bison, buffalo, peacock, lion, brahminy duck, arjuna tree, silk-cotton tree) are in Rigveda books 6,3,7,4,2 which are the old books - consistent with Mittani iconography.

• Mittanis speak later RV-derived Sanskrit, so they were very likely residents of India because early Rigvedic has to be in the Sapta Sindhu regions which showcase a geographical Cline from Haryana/UP to Afghanistan.

• So, either Sintashta/Andronovo is too late to be a source, and _assuming Steppe hypothesis as religious sacrosanct fact_, puts it back further to Fatayanavo culture as a source. Or we need to consider an alternative hypothesis akin to Heggarty et al. Steppe admixture in Indians has a mean date range of 1000-500 BC as per Dates analysis by Narasimhan et al. Swat samples also have **female mediated steppe ancestry** which puts a male mediated invasion to question.

• y-DNA wise, L657 is nowhere to be found in Sintashta-Andronovo but is the dominant R1a1a of south Asia. As far as I can tell Y3/L657 formation precedes Z94.

All these are aspects that need to be clearly addressed and not brushed under the carpet to force-fit into a linear Kurgan route.
